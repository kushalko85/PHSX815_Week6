`MC.py` performs integration for the function 4x^3exp(-x) using trapezoidal method, gauss quadrature method and Monte_Carlo method. The procedure to run this code can be found by typing,

`MC.py -h` in the terminal.


Analytical integration of our function in the limits from 0 to 5 gives 17.6393780328633. 
If we use 20 steps for our numerical integration trapezoid rule will give us the solution to be 17.63248528195609 and Gauss quadrature method gives us 17.639377155148335 . The Monte_carlo simulation gives 18.052959306772138 which is not that accurate compared to others. This shows that even though Monte-Carlo simulations amy be effiecient for the integrations involving higher dimensions, for lower dimensions it is not necessarily the most effective one.
